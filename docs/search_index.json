This guide walks your through these steps. Each of the following steps is described in detail below: Create results folder Final score review Methods document Results document Updates document Update the website Finalize and create a “release” for repositories Upload to repository 5.1 Create results folder We summarize the results from each year’s assessment in the yearly_results/global20?? folder, located in the ohi-global repository. After the OHI scores have been updated with the new data layers a global20?? folder should be created in the ohi-global/yearly_results folder, and populated with: an empty “data_check” and “Results” folder a copy of the README“,”Results_first_look.Rmd“,”Results/Supplement_Results.Rmd“, and”Results/functions\" from the previous year you may find other files from previous years to be useful as well, but only copy them as needed (many of the files were created to meet needs specific to a particular assessment year) The Results_first_look.Rmd creates an internal html document that provides our first look at the scores. This is mostly used internally to explore and check results. This script also does the following: copies the scores.csv from the eez folder to this (yearly_results/global20??) folder and appends the current date to the filename. This allows us to version control our data so we can keep better track of it. This is especially handy during the final stages of an assessment when there are lots of versions of the data flying around email and such! creates a user friendly version of the data called OHI_final_formattted_scores_date.csv. This is typically the version of data we provide to people. creates most of the data in the Results/data folder and figures in the Results/figures folder. It will be necessary to carefully walk through the previous year’s version of the Results_first_look.Rmd file and make relevant updates as needed, such as: on ~ line 88 change: update_data = TRUE on ~ line 84 change the dateFile to the current date, e.g., dateFile = '2018-10-03' correct links: Data read through to correct references to scores/regions If there are any changes to the scores the Results_first_look.Rmd must be updated and rerun. 5.2 Final score review Once all the data layers have been updated we conduct a final review of the scores, which involves these steps: Update and disperse the Results_first_look.html to team members to review. Meeting with team members to discuss scores, document questions/concerns in a new Github issue. To address these concerns, review the data/code and, if necessary, update the scores with corrections to the data or code. These checks are performed via R/Rmd scripts in the yearly_results/global20??/data_check folder. The results from each check is also documented in the Github issue. Update and rerun the Results_first_look.Rmd as needed If necessary, we have a second meeting to discuss the updated scores (usually this isn’t necessary). 5.3 Methods document Every year we update a document describing the methods used to calculate the assessment (example methods document: https://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/published/global_supplement/Supplement.htmlhttps://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/published/global_supplement/Supplement.html). This file can be accessed from our OHI-science global webpage. The files used to create this document are located here: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/global_supplement To maximize flexibility, we have broken our methods into component parts that can be used in multiple contexts. For example, the Rmd files that describe each data layer are incorporated into the official methods document and are also used to create a webpage describing the data layers. Previously, if we updated our methods we had to update both the methods document and the website, but with this approach we only have to make the change in one location. This helps keep our messaging more consistent. Table: A description of the files in the ohi-global/global_supplement repository folder/file name description updates Supplement.Rmd combines all components to create the final methods document No changes to this script are likely necessary, but this Rmd must be knitted when any components change (see description below) CombineLayers.R Combines all the layer Rmds located in the layers_info folder into a single Rmd file called layers_all.Rmd No changes to this script are likely necessary, but this R file must be run whenever there are changes to any of the data layer Rmds layers_all.Rmd Created by CombineLayers.R, includes a description of all data layers Created automatically when CombineLayers.R is run OHI.bib A .bib file of the OHI references (more on that below) Updated yearly BIBcorrect.R Corrects weirdness in the .bib file This probably will need to be updated yearly; this will be determined after reviewing the formatted citation list tables folder with datatables of 10 goal and 8 subgoals No changes likely necessary index_scores.Rmd description of OHI model for calculating index scores No changes likely necessary goal_model.Rmd description of OHI model for calculating goal scores No changes likely necessary trend.Rmd description of OHI model for calculating trend scores No changes likely necessary pressure.Rmd description of OHI model for calculating pressure scores No changes likely necessary resilience. Rmd description of OHI model for calculating resilience scores No changes likely necessary goal_descriptions folder individual Rmd files describing each goal/subgoal Minimal changes to some files may be necessary if the model or data used in a goal changes goal_descriptions_short folder individual Rmd files with a short description of each goal/subgoal Minimal changes to some files may be necessary if the model or data used in a goal changes layers_info folder individual Rmd files with descriptions of each data layer, filenames must match layer names in eez_layers_meta_data datatables Changes to some layers will probably be necessary, but most layers will require no changes figures folder figures displayed in the Supplement.html No changes likely necessary methods-in-ecology-and-evolution.csl instructions for displaying references no need to change unless a different way of displaying references is desired 5.3.1 Steps to updating methods document The methods document is created by knitting ohi-global/global_supplement/Supplement.Rmd. However, many preparations need to be made prior to knitting. 5.3.1.1 Step 1: Update eez_layers_meta_data The data tables in ohi-global/eez_layers_meta_data are used to create the methods document, and consequently must be fully up-to-date and accurate! This includes: layers_eez_base.csv, layers_eez_data_sources.csv, layers_eez_methods.csv, and layers_eez_targets.csv. Currently, the layers_eez_gapfill.csv is not used to create the methods document, but it is still a good idea to update this as well. layers_eez_base.csv This file includes the directory and file name for each of the updated layers. Updates to this file should be completed when you are updating each layer to global (see Chapter 4, Updating Scores). layers_eez_data_sources.csv After being invited to the OHI group Zotero library, you will create a new reference for each of the data sources that have been update for the current assessment year. This can be done easily by downloading Zotero to your computer and installing the extension in your browser. Create citations in Zotero and update the information, including title, author, abstract, date, URL, and accessed date. “Date” should indicate the year listed in the data citation, OR the most recent year in the dataset if no citation exists. “Accessed” should align with the date indicated in the data prep .Rmd file, OR the timestamp on the saved raw data files if a download date is not obvious. Example of completed citation information in Zotero: One you have completed filling in citation information, right click the item in Zotero and choose “Export Item…”. Export as a BibLaTeX file and save as a .bib to your computer. Open this file in a text editing app and copy the tag at the beginning: Paste this tag into layers_eez_data_sources.csv in the ds_reference column. If it is an update to an existing data source, copy over it and update the ds_years column for the time range of the data (also found in the Rmd, or within the data source itself). Check to make sure the other information is still accurate, and add a new column “ds_updated_20??” to indicate which references have been updated. Fill in “y” if you are updating an existing data source. If it is a new data source, paste the tag into a new line and fill in the other information (name, description, years, and native resolution). For all references that were not updated, fill in the ds_updated_20?? with “n” or “NA”. layers_eez_methods.csv This file contains information for three different aspects of every layer - the dataprep url, data source reference, and methods updates. Information should be filled in for all three of these sections for each layer that has been updated. dataprep_url: File path to the knitted html file . Note: finalized data prep files should all be knitted BEFORE attempting to update this document, as this can take some time! ds_reference: Alias tag created BibLaTeX file as described above. This tag should match exactly with the tag in layers_eez_data_sources.csv. methods_update: Short description of updates to the data; usually is additional year of data and/or changes to gapfilling methods or other calculations. Example of complete updated data for the ao_need layer: layers_eez_gapfill.csv Add file path location of gapfilling report for each layer. layers_eez_targets.csv Coming soon! 5.3.1.2 Step 2: Update OHI.bib Make sure all references are included in the OHI Zotero library (see for more information: Coming Soon!). Then export the OHI library as a BibLaTeX file and replace the OHI.bib file in ohi-global/global_supplement with the updated file. We have noticed that some of the OHI.bib entries need to be modified to report correctly. For example, when the author of a report is an agency, such as the US State Depart, it will be reported as “Depart, US”. For this reason, we use the BIBcorrect.R file to correct and then overwrite the OHI.bib file. 5.3.1.3 Step 3: Update layers_info The layers_info folder includes an Rmd file for every data layer used to calculate the global OHI assessment. The files describe the general methods and data used to generate the layer. Ideally, these Rmd files do not include information that changes each year (e.g., final year of data used in analysis, links to data preparation files on Github, etc), so they can be used each year with minimal changes. Components that change every year should be included in tables, such as those in _ohi-global/eez_layers_meta_data. However, if there have been changes to the model or data used to generate a layer it will be necessary to update the corresponding Rmd file. After the Rmds have been updated it is necesary to run the CombineLayers.R file, which merges all the layer information into a single document, layers_all.Rmd. 5.3.1.4 Step 4: Review other files Review whether any of the other files require editing. There may be changes to the text to make it clearer, but otherwise, the following files are unlikely to change: There will be no changes to the following files: goal_model.Rmd, insex_scores.Rmd, pressure.Rmd, resilience.Rmd, or trend.Rmd, unless changes are made to the OHI models (which is unlikely). The Rmds describing the goal models in the goal_descriptions and goal_descriptions_short folders will only change if there have been changes to the goal model or data. Changes to the goal/subgoal descriptions in the “tables” folder are unlikely. 5.3.1.5 Step 5: Knit Supplement.Rmd Review the Supplement.Rmd document to update the assessment year (i.e., title at top, assessmentYear variable in this code chunk, update figure 3.1). Knit the file and review the html output. Make any necessary changes and repeat…seemingly endlessly until everything is correct. 5.4 Results document After producing the final scores, we create a document that describes the results of the assessment: https://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/published/global2018/Results/Supplement_Results.html. This file can be accessed from our OHI-science global webpage. The file is created using this Rmd: ohi-global/yearly_results/global20??/Results/Supplment_Results.Rmd. It is critical to carefully step through this script and modify as needed; for example, the date of the radicalFile object must match the date appended to the csv file of scores created by Results_first_look.rmd (e.g., radicalFile = ‘2018-10-10’, ~line 92). And, of course, freely modify this script to reflect the data/figures you believe will be most useful to people. This could involve editing text, removing particular figures, adding figures, etc. NOTE: If there are any changes to the scores, it is important to run the Results_first_look.Rmd file prior to running this script. Many of the figures in the Supplement_Results document are actually generated by the Results_first_look.Rmd script. 5.5 Updates document 5.6 Upload to a repository One of the final steps of an assessment is submitting the final data (and related files) to a data repository. This makes the files publicly available and provides a DOI (digital object identifier, https://www.doi.org/) used to officially cite the data. We have been using the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, or KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/) as our data repository. An example of our data on KNB is here: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/F12Z13R6 Signing into KNB requires an ORCID account. An ORCID account is obtained here: https://orcid.org/register. You will then make your way to https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/. Select the SIGN IN tab, and then “Sign in with ORCID”: Select the “Upload data”, and start adding files and information: The following is the information we used for the 2018 assessment, but please modify and improve as desired! 5.6.0.1 Overview Title: Global Ocean Health Index 2018 assessment Abstract: Scores from the 2018 global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessment and accompanying data and models. The global Ocean Health Index assesses ocean health for 220 coastal countries and territories and has been conducted yearly since 2012. The Index describes how well we are sustainably managing 10 goals which represent the full suite of benefits that people want and need from the ocean. These goals include: artisanal fishing opportunity, biodiversity, carbon storage, clean waters, coastal livelihoods and economies, coastal protection, food provision, natural products, sense of place, and tourism and recreation. Each goal is given a score ranging from 0 to 100, and the full suite of goal scores are then averaged to obtain an overall index score for each region. Please see http://ohi-science.org/ for additional resources and information. Keywords: OHI, index, ocean 5.6.0.2 People OHI team (including the OHI Fellows) Contacts: If in doubt, put Benjamin Halpern 5.6.0.3 Dates First data is 2012. The later date is the year of the assessment. 5.6.0.4 Locations Short geographic description: Global country and territorial EEZ regions (N=220) Northwest coordinates: 90 -180 Southeast coordinates: -90 180 5.6.0.5 Taxa NA 5.6.0.6 Methods Step 1: See Methods.html file 5.6.0.7 Add Files Please use your judgment, but we included the following files in the global 2018 assessment: scores.csv: scores file that is created secondarily to include region names and expanded goal names. Methods.html: methods used to calculate the global OHI scores (this is created in the global_supplement folder in the ohi-global repository). Global_OHI_Results: Figures and tables of global results. This is currently an informal document, but I would like to improve this in future years. Zip files of the 3 repositories used to calculate the global OHI assessment: ohiprep, ohi-global, and ohicore. These files are downloaded from the “release” version of repository (this assumes you have already created the release). You navigate to the release by first going to the repository of interest and selecting “releases”: Then download the .zip option: Once all the information has been entered and the files uploaded to the KNB site you can obtain a link for your data. Navigate to “My data sets” and select the one you are working on from the list and copy the web address. Create an issue and provide the link so anyone who wants to review the information can do so. You can easily edit everything at this point! NOTE: At this point the data does not have an official DOI. Once everyone is satisfied with the content, you can officially “Publish with DOI”: The data now officially has a DOI, and you can mark this off your list of things to do! "]
